# Python Ping Pong Game

This Python code uses the turtle graphics module to create a traditional Pong game. The players use paddles on each side of the screen to deflect a ball back and forth. When the ball travels through a paddle, it scores points.

## Key features:

- Visuals: The turtle module generates a game window with a black backdrop, yellow paddles, and a pink ball.
- Players may move their paddles up and down by using the "W" and "S" keys (left paddle) and the Up and Down arrow keys (right paddle).
- Ball Movement: The ball bounces across the screen with a predetermined beginning velocity, changing direction when it reaches the top or bottom boundaries.
- Points are granted to the opposing player when the ball passes a paddle. The score appears in the centre of the screen.
- Game Loop: The code uses a while True loop to constantly update the game state, such as the ball's location, collision detection, and scorekeeping.
